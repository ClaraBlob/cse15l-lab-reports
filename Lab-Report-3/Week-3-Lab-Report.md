# **Week 3 Lab Report**
## **Command :**  `less`

Some of the commands that I will be using will have an addition command option of `-N` which displays the line numbers of the text file to make viewing the text clearer and easier to explain my examples. Also, I took some screenshots because many of the command options highlight words in the text file but you can't highlight anything inside a code block.

**Website used:**
[less-command-in-linux](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/less-command-in-linux)

## **Command Option #1:**`less -X [filename]`
 
This command line option makes it so that when quitting `less`, it doesn't clear the the output of the text files (which is similar to using the `cat` command on a text file). 
 
### **Example 1:**
```
$ less -XN travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRIbiza.txt

      2   
      3

      6         Recommended Hotels
      7         The establishments listed below offer a cross-section of
      8         local restaurants, and should convince you that not everything on the
      9         island comes with chips (french fries).
     10         The star rating in brackets after each entry refers to the
     11         offfical government rating system.
     12         As a basic guide, the symbols we use indicate what you can
     13         expect to pay for a three-course meal for two, excluding wine, tax and
     14         tip. Drinks will add considerably to the final bill.
     15         ✪less than 5,000 ptas.
     16         ✪✪5,000–8,000 ptas.
     17         ✪✪✪more than 8,000 ptas.
     18       
     19     
     20   
```
**Explanation:**
This is displays the `HandRIbiaza.txt` file and when upon quitting `less`, the text stays on the screen while the user can also utilize the command line again. This is very useful because it allows the user to have the outputted text file visible to them while also being able to use the command line making it easier to for them to see what other commands they can use on that text file.

### **Example 2:**
```
$ less -XN travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRIstanbul.txt

      6         Recommended Hotels
      7         Finding accommodation in Istanbul is rarely a problem, as
      8         the city has recently seen a boom in the hotel business. However, if
      9         you want a room in a particular hotel, it is best to book, especially
     10         during July and August. The main hotel areas are Laleli, Aksaray, and
     11         Sultanahmet in the Old City, and around Taksim Square in Beyo‘lu.
     12         Intense competition among the middle-range hotels means that you can
     13         often bargain for a lower rate, especially if you plan to stay for more
     14         than two nights.
     15         As a basic guide we have used the symbols below to indicate
     16         prices for a double room with bath, including breakfast:
     17         ❁❁❁❁❁over £130 ($200)
     18         ❁❁❁❁£80–130 ($120-200)
     19         ❁❁❁£50–80 ($75-120)
     20         ❁❁£30–50 ($45-75)
     21         ❁below £30 ($45
     22       
     23     
     24   
```
**Example of using `/you` in less and then quitting:**
 ![Image](./Lab-Report-3-Photos/Lab_Report_3_less_X_command.png)

**Explanation:**
This is displays the `HandRIstanbul.txt` file and when upon quitting `less`, the text doesn't disapper. Another use for this command option is that it can be used to easily compare two texts because they are both visible and you can utilize the `/` commands in the `less` mode, such as `/pattern` and `/m<letter>` in which its output will stay on the file. For example, if you use `/you`, it will highlight all the occurances of `you` in the text file and when quitting, those highlights will remain.


## **Command Option #2:** `less -j [filename]`
 This marks the lines with a `*` next to them which matched the search and any lines that are marked.

       5 Zoot Suit
       6 A style of suit worn by African Americans, Filipino Americans, and Mexican Americans during the 1930s and 1940s. In Chicano culture this style of dress is primarily associated with the pachucos o       
       6 f the 1940s. The fashion at that time was to wear very baggy pants with pegged legs, long jackets with high and sharp shoulder pads, thick-soled shoes, and long watch chains dangling from the bel       
       6 t. An addition to the whole style common to Chicanos was a particular haircut, long with a ducktail and a wide-brimmed hat.
       7 The word zoot was known within the urban jazz culture of Harlem, and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style. Many African Americans wore an extravagant style of clothing       
       7 , the baggy pegged pants and jackets with padded shoulders, that later became known as the zoot suit. In the novel Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison, he describes the zoot--suiters’ style, “walking        
       7 slowly, their shoulders swaying, their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles; their coats long and hip-tight with shoulders fa       
       7 r too broad to be those of natural western men” (1947, 380). In the late-night jazz scenes of Harlem this style was “a killer-diller coat with a drape-shape, reat-pleats and shoulders padded like       
       7  a lunatic’s cell” (380). Tyler makes the point that the zoot suit was an extremely symbolic costume, which gave the wearer the look of a child in adult clothing. The broad square shoulders gave        
       7 a macho look to the youth, and the finger-tipped coat was made for fun and leisure. The long baggy pants were made for dancing, especially the jitterbug, and the wide Panama hats were another sig       
       7 n of adulthood. “The business of fun, dancing and dating were the key characteristics displayed by Zoot-Suiters. It was an escape from drudgery and futile labor to the bliss of free-wheeling move       
       7 ment in the city among youths in the new youth culture” (Tyler, 23). Prominent black entertainers wore the zoot suit, such as Cab Calloway, Sammy Davis Jr., and Duke Ellington. Ellington performe       
       7 d at the Orpheum in Los Angeles in 1941 and 1942 with a musical called Jump for Joy in which the performers wore zoot suits, also known as Gone with the Wind suits, after the style worn by Clark        
       7 Gable in the movie by the same name.
       8 Even though the zoot suit was worn by the young men of several different races and ethnicities, it is primarily identified with the pachucos of Los Angeles. Pachucos were mostly second-generation       
       8  Mexicans, the sons of migrant laborers and working-class immigrants. Pachucos created their own subculture, an arrogant style of dressing, a bilingual secret argot, and for some individuals memb       
       8 ership in petty criminal gangs. The zoot suit became a symbolic disguise that identified the zoot-suiter as neither a Mexican nor an American. It was not a bicultural or binational position, but        
       8 rather a position between cultures, a “hanging in space” position. The overly confident, slow swagger of the pachuco, today exemplified by the cholo, made it appear in fact as if the zoot-suiter        
       8 were walking on air.
       9 During the summer of 1943 the attention of the whole country was on Los Angeles when gangs of sailors and zoot-suiters battled with each other in the streets of the city. It is unclear if this wa       
       9 s a race riot or a riot of patriotic sailors who attacked, beat, and stripped young Mexican Americans whom they perceived to be unpatriotic zoot-suiters. Between the third and thirteenth of June        
       9 zoot-suiters were open targets. Much has been written about these riots from both literary and historical perspectives.
      10 During the late 1970s the zoot suit received wide recognition and popularity with the production of a successful play by Luis Valdez. In 1981 a film by the same name, Zoot Suit, was produced and       
      10 directed by Luis Valdez, with performances by actors Daniel Valdez and Edward James Olmos.

      13 Zozobra
      14 A giant, forty-foot effigy in the form of a puppet, which is burned during the annual Santa Fe Fiesta held in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The word Zozobra translates to “gloom” or “worry” or “anguished      
      14 .” The Zozobra is ritualistically burned at the beginning of the fiesta, which symbolizes the end of destructiveness, gloom, and worry, setting the tone for a successful fiesta. The creation of Z      
      14 ozobra was introduced into the fiesta in 1926 by Will Shuster, who felt that the fiesta had become “dull and commercialized.” Throughout the years the image of Zozobra changed from a simple twent      
      14 y-foot puppet to the elaborate forty-foot figure with animated eyes, arms, and mouth that he is today. In 1969 Shuster turned over the responsibility and copyright of Zozobra to the Kiwanis Club       
      14 of Santa Fe. He is hung on a tall pole on a hill, outside the city, where the burning can be seen by the thousands of people who come to watch. The death of gloom is supposed to resurrect happine

      15 In response to the tradition of the burning of Zozobra, a group of New Mexico Chicanos started a tradition of burning El Kookoóee, a figure known by many Chicanos as the bogeyman, during the Fest      
      15 ival de Otoño.

**Explanation: **
Using `less -NJ non-fiction/OUP/Castro/chZ.txt` command and typying in `/zoot` highlighted all the occurances of `zoot` in the text file with additional to signifying which lines those occurances appear. Also, the format has duplicate lines due to the fact that its trying to have all the words into one screen so all of the occurances are visible at once. That `less -J [filename]` command is helpful for marking where occurances of an input and to take note which lines those occurances appear in.

       5 Yard Shrines
       6 The creation of yard displays, as shrines or ofrendas (offerings), or nacimientos (nativity scenes) during Christmas, is an important way to commemorate many holidays such as Halloween, Día de lo       
       6 s Muertos (Day of the Dead), Cinco de Mayo (Fifth of May), and even the Fourth of July. A yard shrine may be a permanent display in the form of a small chapel, a nicho (niche), or a gruta (grotto       
       6  or shrine), set up in the front yard of a home. It may contain one or more holy images, of saints or the Virgin Mary, especially La Virgen de Guadalupe, flowers or potted plants, colorful garlan       
       6 ds, and votive candles. These shrines are often just called nichos, and the word shrine is not even mentioned. During special holidays such as Christmas or on a saint’s feast day, a shrine may be       
       6  lighted up for the community to share. It is a common practice to make the sign of the cross or recite a short prayer when walking past a religious yard shrine.
       7 In many families the shrine is erected as the result of a promesa or manda (promise or vow) made to a particular saint, or in memory of a family member who has died. A yard shrine, whether called       
       7  a nicho or a gruta, can be decorated in various ways. There are always plants and flowers, sometimes seashells decorate the outside if it is constructed of cement, and the decorations will refle       
       7 ct the holiday season of the year. At Christmas, there may be lights, tinsel, and poinsettias. During Lent there may be lilies and pastel paper chains. Yard shrines demonstrate that religion is i       
       7 ntegrated into the life of a family, and they are considered to be sacred sites for prayer and devotion. There is no division between the public life and the religious and devotional life of a Ch       
       7 icano family. A yard shrine is a public exhibition of a family’s religion and their devotion to a particular saint, as well as a display of an artistic sensibility, that emerges unconsciously fro       
       7 m the family’s beliefs.
       8 A related form of yard folk art, not necessarily religious, is the yard asamblea (assemblage). A well-known man in Los Angeles, referred to as “El Hombre de las Banderas” (The Man of the Flags),        
       8 created spectacular scenes up until his death in 1992. Art created in the yard of one’s home serves to draw in the community and make it a participant. These yard sculptures are created from bits       
       8  and pieces of contemporary life and popular culture, drawn from many different sources.

      11 Yardas (Gardens)
      12 Although the Spanish word for garden is jardín, many Chicano families favor the term “yard” while referring to their gardens, pronouncing it in Spanish as yarda. Although yarda appears to be a po      
      12 chismo (Chicano slang), it can be found in Cassell’s Spanish Dictionary. The layout and organizational aesthetics of Chicano yardas are unique enough that folklorists and cultural geographers hav      
      12 e written about them. Many yardas can aesthetically constitute yard art, even though it does not appear that this is the intent of the creator. Besides planting shrubs, flowers, and sometimes gra      
      12 ss, the gardener will bring into play the creativity that goes into decorating a yard unconsciously, with the result being a folk art display. Invariably, a yard will contain many potted flowers       
      12 arranged in a patterned manner. The central focus of many yards is often a devotional shrine set up in memory of a family member, with a nicho housing a saint or Madonna, and the design of the ya      
      12 rd’s plants and flowers is laid out in reference to the shrine. Some yardas may not have planted grass, but instead hard-packed dirt that is kept free of weeds, swept frequently, and kept prepare      
      12 d for family gatherings. But trees, preferably fruit trees, abound to make shade for family gatherings and outdoor cooking.
      13 A common practice among many working-class Mexican Americans is to recycle as much as possible, although the concept that recycling is an environmentally correct thing to do is not always known.       
      13 Common recycled objects that can be found in yards are tables, kitchen pots, painted tin cans, and car tires used as planters. Tires are cut across the width, making two containers, opened up and      
      13  cut with a scalloped design around the edges. After being painted and filled with flowers and plants, these plant containers do not even resemble their original form. Recycled tire planters can       
      13 line a driveway or establish the boundaries of a large yard. The practice of reusing objects that have lost their original purpose, such as kitchen pitchers and pots, is a means of keeping someth      
      13 ing familiar, something associated with a memory, alive and finding a new use for it. This practice probably originates from poverty, but the historical result has been that it creates its own ae      
      13 sthetic in adding adornment to one’s home and life. These “yardscapes,” as they’ve come to be called, are composed of bits and pieces of one’s personal life and as such can add visual charm and h      
      13 istorical value to a home. A family’s religious and cultural values, as well as the special identity of being Mexican American, can be found in yardas.

That `less -J [filename]` command allows for the comparison of multiple files when using the `/search` command. This is very helpful if you are trying to compare what words or phrases one file has to another one. You can see on which lines those occurrences happen and compare it to the other files.

## **Command Option #3:** `less -p[pattern] [filename]`

 This command tells `less` to start at the first occurrence of the specified pattern of the specified file and it allow highlights all of the occurances as well.

two
in and out of fashion


Bryant Park, in midtown Manhattan, is the site of a bi-annual fashion show. Twice a year, in large white tents crammed with reporters, photographers, editors, and celebrity guests, models parade designers’ wares on the runway. Bryant Park is also a good place to observe an architectural fashion show. A row of Twenties beauties lines 40th Street, along the south side of the park. First is Ely Jacques Kahn’s French Renaissance office building, originally the headquarters of Scientific American. Its neighbor is the stately Classical Engineers Club. Then comes a flapper, Raymond Hood’s American Radiator Building, whose black brick and gold trim sets it apart from its neighbors. Charles Rich’s Bryant Park Studios, an elegant survivor of the late Gilded Age, is at the Sixth Avenue corner. The large north-facing windows and glazed penthouse are a reminder that this building was originally intended for artists.
Bryant Park Studios is built in an architectural style that was originally called Modern French but today is commonly referred to as Beaux-Arts, in recognition of the influential Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Starting with Richard Morris Hunt, during the second half of the nineteenth century many of the best American architects were graduates of the Ecole. H. H. Richardson and his protégé Charles Follen McKim were alumni, as well as McKim’s assistants, John M. Carrère and Thomas Hastings. Carrère and Hastings were the architects of the New York Public Library, whose stately presence commands the east side of Bryant Park. Narrow strips of windows indicate the book-stacks, above them nine thermal windows signal the vast reading room. In typical Beaux-Arts fashion, the façade manages to appear both grandly monumental and coolly rational, except for a curious row of little doorways high up the wall, which lack balconies or even railings and open into mid-air. The strange little sky-exits, which a friend who works at the library claims are for staff defenestration, provide a fanciful note to the great marble façade.*
A row of no-nonsense 1970s office blocks lines Sixth Avenue on the west side of the park. The largest is the New York Telephone Company Building, whose banal façade of gray-tinted glass and vertical strips of marble fills the block between 41st and 42nd Street. The north side of the park is dominated by the fifty-story W. R. Grace Building, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1972. The swooping travertine façade appears to have been inspired by the buildings of Brasília. This bit of tropical flash is flanked by an undistinguished mirrored glass tower, and a generic brick-and-Colonial-trim box. Built 50 years apart, these commercial office blocks share a balefully functionalist approach to architecture. They are strictly off-the-rack buildings that only a developer could love.
Bryant Park also offers distant views of two of Manhattan’s most distinctive skyscrapers: the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. The Chrysler Building started life as a speculative office building. In 1927, the architect William Van Alen, influenced by the recent Parisian exhibition of the arts décoratifs, designed a skyscraper in a style that has come to be known as Art Deco. When the plans were finished, but before construction had begun, the design and the building site were bought by the automobile magnate Walter P. Chrysler. Chrysler wanted the building to serve as a billboard for his company. Van Alen obligingly grafted on eagle-head gargoyles (based on hood ornaments), winged radiator caps, a frieze of steel hubcaps, and black brick accents that suggest running boards. The tower’s most distinctive feature was its stainless-steel cap, which held the Cloud Club, a private dining room for Chrysler executives. Today, the flamboyant Chrysler Building is considered a brilliant emblem of the Jazz Age, but it was not an instant success. When it was built it was roundly criticized as frivolous and flashy. “A stunt design,” sniffed The New Yorker. The New York Times likewise derided the blatant commercialism of the architecture.
The Chrysler Building had the distinction of being the world’s tallest building—for a few months, until it was surpassed by the Empire State Building. Although designed at the same time as the Chrysler, the Empire State is quite different in appearance. Its exterior is the architectural equivalent of a gray flannel suit. There is no decoration. The plain limestone walls lack even traditional cornices; chrome-nickel steel mullions extend uninterrupted from the 6th to the 85th floor, accentuating the building’s height. “Ornament is crime” Adolf Loos had proclaimed years before, but the stripped-down appearance of the Empire State Building owed more to an accelerated building schedule—construction took less than eighteen months—than to architectural ideology. In fact, the architects of the skyscraper considered themselves traditionalists. Richmond H. Shreve worked for Carrère & Hastings on the New York Public Library, where he met William Lamb, a recent Ecole graduate. After Carrère’s unfortunate death in an auto accident and Hastings’ retirement, Shreve and Lamb took over the firm (for several years it was called Carrère & Hastings, Shreve & Lamb) and were eventually joined by Arthur Loomis Harmon, who had worked for McKim, Mead & White on the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Despite—or rather because of—their solid Classical roots, Shreve, Lamb and Harmon designed a beautifully proportioned building that became the most famous skyscraper in the world.
The Empire State Building has one whimsical touch. The final plans called for the skyscraper to end with a flat roof over the 85th floor—1,050 feet, precisely calculated to be two feet higher than the top of the Chrysler Building’s spire. Then, before construction began, the owners decided that two feet was not enough, and ordered the architects to add a 200-foot tower to the top of the building.* This was to be not merely a decorative spire but a functioning symbol of the modern age, a mooring tower for airships. Instead of dropping transatlantic travelers off at Lakehurst, N.J., the thousand-foot-long dirigibles would fly right into Manhattan and hook themselves up to the top of the Empire State Building. Passengers would disembark to an observation platform and descend by elevator to a lounge and customs area on the 86th floor. Most experts, including Hugo Eckener, commander of the Graf Zeppelin, doubted that it could be done. It was hard enough to dock the unwieldy leviathans at ground level, never mind 1,250 feet up in the air. The experts proved to be right, and no airship passengers ever landed atop the Empire State.1 Yet the rocket-shaped tower, with its cast aluminum buttresses and gleaming conical top, is the perfect fanciful crown for this rather solemn skyscraper.
Whimsy is absent from the tops of the 1970s office blocks around Bryant Park. They look as if the architects had lopped them off on a whim: “I can do 40 floors, or 42, or 45. Just tell me when to stop.” More recent skyscrapers around Bryant Park, no doubt emboldened by Philip Johnson’s Chippendale top on his AT&T Building, have more animated crowns. The hipped roof of a Fifth Avenue Postmodern high-rise adorned with circles and squares peeks out above the library. The top of the Bertelsmann Building is a slender spike. The new Condé Nast office tower has tilted forms resembling speaker cabinets on its roof. Pretty tame stuff compared to the more fanciful crowns of the 1920s buildings—neo-Gothic spires, Romanesque tile roofs, copper domes. The 58 floors of 500 Fifth Avenue (at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street), which was designed by Shreve & Lamb prior to the Empire State Building, step back dramatically as they reach the building’s apex. Spiky, wrought-iron finials enliven the chateau-like roof of the Scientific American Building. An animated silhouette of black brick with gilded and red highlights crowns the Radiator Building. According to Hood, the dramatic effect (floodlit at night) suggested a “pile of coal, glowing at the top.”
Raymond M. Hood was the outstanding commercial architect of the 1920s. He and John Mead Howells won a celebrated international architectural competition for the Chicago Tribune tower in Chicago with a handsome Gothic design based on the Butter Tower of Rouen Cathedral. The Chicago Tribune competition led to several New York commissions, including the Radiator Building, the Daily News Building, and the McGraw-Hill Building. With these designs, Hood developed the distinctly American approach to skyscrapers that would influence Van Alen and a generation of skyscraper designers: tall buildings conceived as Nietzschean symbols of corporate power or, to put it more mundanely, architecture as advertising. Hood once pointed out that since modern office buildings would be amortized in only 20 years, architects had an opportunity to experiment. The Daily News is a robust pinnacle, with alternating vertical strips of masonry and glass. His final skyscraper, the McGraw-Hill Building, is a witty blue-green take on the International Style, complete with the company’s name in huge “Broadway” style lettering on the top. Hood was also one of the key designers in the team of architects responsible for Rockefeller Center. His influence is felt in the centerpiece tower, the 70-story cliff-like RCA Building. This twentieth-century abstracted version of medieval verticality is one of New York’s most evocative skyscrapers, unsurpassed since it was completed in 1934.

Bryant Park chronicles a hundred years of changing architectural fashions. Buildings are sometimes referred to as timeless, as if this were the highest praise one could bestow. That is nonsense. The best buildings, like the Chrysler or the New York Public Library or the RCA, are precisely of their time. That is part of the pleasure of looking at buildings from the past. They reflect old values and bygone virtues and vices: the self-confidence of the library, the cheerful boosterism of Chrysler, the sobriety of RCA. Even the bland goofiness of the Grace Building recalls the naïve optimism of an earlier era. That is why old buildings are precious, that is why we fight to preserve them. It is not only because we think them beautiful, or significant. It is also because they remind us of who we once were. And of who we might be again, for old buildings also inspire. The ruins of ancient Rome inspired the Renaissance architects. The palazzos of Renaissance Italy inspired Charles McKim. And the memory of McKim’s Pennsylvania Station inspired David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to transform McKim’s old Post Office Building into a projected railroad terminal for the city.
Sometimes old buildings inspire us, sometimes the opposite is true. We look at an old building and ask ourselves, “What on earth were those people thinking of?” I cannot warm to heroic public buildings of the 1960s, for example. It is more than 35 years since Lincoln Center was built, enough time for the buildings to mellow, yet I can’t summon any sympathy for the colonnaded brutes. The idea of putting three theaters under one roof must have been compelling at one time, but when I visit the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., all I see are miles of red carpeting in those Brobdingnagian lobbies. Yet, who knows? Perhaps one day a future generation will see something in these buildings that eludes me.
The Kennedy Center was criticized from the start, but the dazzling décor of Radio City Music Hall, which opened in 1932—in the midst of the Depression—guaranteed its immediate success. Radio City became the most famous theater in the country, the Rockettes the most famous chorus line, “live from Radio City” the most famous dateline. In the late 1950s, when I visited New York City as a boy with my parents, Radio City was still one of the obligatory tourist sites. What I don’t remember is ever learning about Radio City as an architecture student. According to the reductive standards of my International Style teachers, its opulent materials, its glowing colors, and its very theatricality disqualified Radio City as architecture (never mind that it was a technologically sophisticated “machine for entertainment”). It was dismissed as kitsch. By 1978, Radio City had lost its glamour, and the owners of Rockefeller Center decided to demolish the aging hall. Thanks to preservationists’ efforts, the hall was saved from demolition and granted landmark status. Now, 20 years later, freshened by a masterful restoration, it is once again acclaimed as a masterpiece.
Radio City Music Hall is a reminder that it is not buildings that change, but architectural fashions. What seemed exciting in one decade, looks gaudy, if not downright embarrassing, in the next—or simply boring. When old buildings are torn down, the motive may be expediency or crass commercialism, but it may also be a desire for something new. This is as true of buildings as it is of women’s hats, pace Le Corbusier.

Fashion has increasingly—and restrictively—become a term used in connection with women’s dress, as in “fashion designer” or “the fashion industry.” The Oxford English Dictionary defines fashion more broadly as “the mode of dress, etiquette, furniture, style of speech, etc., adopted in a society for the time being.” People have to cut their hair, eat, clothe themselves, decorate their homes—fashion affects how they do these things. According to the French historian Fernand Braudel, fashion affects everything. “It covers ideas as much as costume, the current phrase as much as the coquettish gesture, the manner of receiving at table, the care taken in sealing a letter.”2 There is no reason to think that architecture is immune.
If style is the language of architecture, fashion represents the wide—and swirling—cultural currents that shape and direct that language. Gothic architecture originated in France in the twelfth century, and remained in fashion in Europe for the next three hundred years. It was used in the great cathedrals, and in such secular masterpieces as the Doge’s Palace in Venice, and the Westminster Hall in London. One of the last great Italian Gothic buildings was Milan Cathedral, begun in 1385. It was so large that the domical vault and crossing were not built until 55 years later by the great architect Filippo Brunelleschi. By then the Renaissance was well under way, thanks to Brunelleschi’s Foundling Hospital in Florence, generally considered the first building designed in the revived Classical style. With the rediscovery of Greek and Roman Classicism, Gothic became distinctly unfashionable. The old monuments were preserved, but they were not admired. “A fantastical and licentious manner of building,” is how Christopher Wren characterized Gothic architecture. So general was the dissatisfaction, that Gothic came to stand for anything that was considered wild, barbarous, or crude.
In the mid-eighteenth century, the term Gothic reappeared, not in architecture but in literature. The Gothic romance, a type of novel, was usually set in the medieval past and involved the fantastic and the supernatural. Jane Austen’s heroine in Northanger Abbey is a devotee of such books and spends many hours in “the luxury of a raised, restless, and frightened imagination over the pages of Udolpho.” Austen is referring to Anne Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho, one of the most popular Gothic romances of the day, whose setting is a mysterious castle in the Apennines. Such surroundings—monasteries, dungeons, castles—figured prominently in Gothic tales ever since Horace Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto, which was published in 1764 and is generally considered the first Gothic romance.
In her novel Austen pokes fun at the genre. The abbey of the title is not a haunted ruin in Italy but a converted medieval building in Gloucestershire, complete with modern fireplaces, comfortable furniture, and other domestic conveniences. This is a reminder that by 1798, when Northanger Abbey was written, the Gothic fashion had embraced architecture. Horace Walpole was responsible for that fashion, too. In the 1750s, he had begun a project to enlarge Strawberry Hill, his Thames-side villa near London. While his contemporaries built stately houses in a delicate Classical style that was popularized by Robert and James Adam, the young Walpole, who had an independent frame of mind, looked elsewhere for inspiration. He had been an undergraduate at King’s College, Cambridge and admired its extraordinary Gothic chapel. The exterior of his house was battlemented like a medieval castle. The interior combined historicism with a playful eclecticism. Motifs copied from medieval altar screens ornamented the rooms—stained glass was used in windows and papier-mâché fan-vaults covered the ceiling. Walpole’s extensive collection of historical and modern books, paintings, and curiosities was also mixed in.
Walpole, the Fourth Earl of Orford, spent his entire life enlarging his house. He eventually added a cloister, a gallery, and a tower. As he was an author and a public figure who corresponded with a wide circle of literary and artistic friends throughout Europe, the Gothic design of Strawberry Hill became famous among connoisseurs. (It also became a tourist attraction, much to Walpole’s chagrin.) Architects and their clients now saw medieval buildings as sources of inspiration, just as they had once looked to ancient Greece and Rome. The Gothic style became an established alternative for building country houses, and pointed arches appeared in décor and furniture. Gothic was “in” again.
The revived interest in the Middle Ages was complicated, for fashion is rarely one-dimensional. Gothic meant different things to different people (sometimes different things to the same people). Spooky Gothic novels appealed to readers. Medieval buildings appealed to the current taste for the romantic and the picturesque. Goethe’s 1772 essay on Strassburg Cathedral pointed the way; he admitted to being “a sworn enemy of the tangled arbitrariness of Gothick ornament,” but found himself overcome by the grandeur and mystery of the building, which he described as “a most sublime, wide-arching Tree of God.” The French architectural theorist Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, on the other hand, was attracted by what he interpreted as the rationalism of Gothic construction. So was his English counterpart, George Gilbert Scott, who considered Gothic more “modern” than Classical architecture, hence a more appropriate model for architects. Augustus Welby Pugin, who worked on the British Houses of Parliament, saw a moral dimension to Gothic. He considered medieval architecture to be the ideal of Christian civilization, much as Greece and Rome had been admired as the cradle of classical—but pagan—civilization. John Ruskin, too, considered Gothic a moral force, but since he also loved Venice, polychrome Ruskinian Gothic has many Italian overtones. This incongruity is particularly striking since in England especially (but also in France and Germany), the Gothic style was considered a homegrown product—as opposed to Mediterranean Classicism. This was another cultural appeal of Gothic: at a time of growing nationalism in northern Europe, it conveniently provided a “national” style.
In North America, Gothic was, if anything, even more popular. Canadians chose a British architect and the Gothic style for their Houses of Parliament, which stand on a dramatic bluff overlooking the Ottawa River. Anglophile Americans built Collegiate Gothic campuses, Gothic parish churches, and a Gothic National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Ralph Adams Cram, who was devoted to High Gothic, built the nave and west front of New York City’s Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, the largest Gothic structure in the world. Cram’s partner Bertram Goodhue used a looser Gothic style in the military academy at West Point, as did Cass Gilbert in the Woolworth Building—the so-called Cathedral of Commerce. By then the cultural attributes of Gothic had worn thin. Hood’s Chicago Tribune Building, completed in 1924, was one of the last prominent buildings designed in the Gothic style.
Gothic has not—so far—come back into fashion. Early in his career, Paul Rudolph designed a building for Wellesley College that attempted to relate architecturally to the Collegiate Gothic surroundings. It was his first large commission, and it was not a success. “Wellesley shook me,” Rudolph later recalled, “and I returned to the International Style in my next building.”3 Eero Saarinen built a Gothicized dormitory at Vasser. Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed a Gothic-inspired skyscraper in Pittsburgh that was a giant abstracted glass version of the British Houses of Parliament. This was one of several stylistic forays that Johnson and Burgee made in the 1980s, including a Chippendale-top skyscraper in New York, a French Provincial high-rise in Dallas, and a neo-Burnhamesque tower in Chicago. None is particularly satisfactory, perhaps because they lack conviction. Moshe Safdie’s National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa is more successful. It mimics the Gothic chapter house-cum-library of the adjacent parliament buildings in a crystalline structure of steel and glass. This episode in Safdie’s oeuvre was unique, however, and Gothicized forms do not reappear in his later buildings.
The Classical style has proved more durable. This has something to do with its remarkable adaptability. Whether building an administrative center for the British Raj or designing a station for the Pennsylvania Railroad workable solutions can be devised in the Classical tradition. The cultural overtones of the Classical style are even richer than those of Gothic; they include not only the ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome, but also Renaissance Italian humanism, seventeenth-century Parisian splendor, Georgian London elegance, and English country-house comfort. During the immediate postwar period monumental Classical buildings also acquired authoritarian associations, since they had been fashionable in Nazi Germany and Stalinist Soviet Union. If Gothic was considered a national style by some English architects in the 1800s, Classicism, rooted in the early days of the Republic, has a claim to being America’s national style. This is most evident in Washington, D.C. Except for brief flirtations with Victorian Gothic (the Smithsonian) and functionalist modernism (the Air and Space Museum), Classicism has remained in fashion for federal buildings ever since the construction of the Palladian White House. Washingtonian Classicism has taken many guises, ranging from the Jefferson Memorial (a small version of the Pantheon), to the severely abstract Federal Reserve Board Building. The Federal Triangle and the recent Ronald W. Reagan Building are modern interpretations of the Classical tradition.
While the architecture of federal Washington sometimes overwhelms foreign visitors, it is comfortably familiar to most Americans because of the popularity of a simplified version of Classicism—the so-called American Colonial style, which could more accurately be called American Georgian. In furnishings, décor, and above all in house design, this has been the dominant domestic fashion for the last hundred years. The origin of American Colonial can be dated with some accuracy. January 1874 was the inaugural issue of The New York Sketchbook of Architecture. It was edited by a youthful Charles McKim. The purpose of the publication, McKim wrote, was to document in sketches and photographs, “the beautiful, quaint, and picturesque features which belong to so many buildings, now almost disregarded, of our Colonial and Revolutionary Period.” McKim and his new partners, William Mead and Stanford White, made several sketching trips in New England. They were designers, not preservationists, and their interest was the inspiration found in old buildings. White clapboard walls, black shutters, and pedimented porches started to appear in McKim, Mead & White houses. The 1876 Centennial celebrations made the American public aware of its ancestral past. On a practical level, the understated, comfortable Colonial style was well-suited to prevailing domestic taste. It was also easily—and inexpensively—adapted to small houses. American Colonial remained the height of fashion until the 1940s. In a simplified form—the Cape Cod cottage—it reappeared in postwar Levittowns. It continues today, although the clapboard siding may be vinyl, the columns polystyrene, and the stamped metal shutters more likely symbolic than real.

“The Tribune and Radiator Buildings are both in the ‘vertical’ style or what is called ‘Gothic’ simply because I happened to make them so,” Raymond Hood once flippantly explained. “If at the time of designing them I had been under the spell of Italian campaniles or Chinese pagodas, I suppose the resulting compositions would have been ‘horizontal.’ ”4 Hood was no more comfortable discussing style than other architects. He left unexplained the question of what had put him “under the spell” of Gothic in the first place. It had happened early: Hood’s senior thesis at M.I.T.—he later also studied at the Ecole—had been a church in the Gothic style; his first employer was the Gothicist Ralph Adams Cram; and Hood assisted Bertram Goodhue on West Point. Later in life, Hood occasionally returned to the Gothic style, notably in the handsome Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral in Scranton, Pennsylvania, but he never explained what broke the spell and led him to a more abstract style.
Like any successful architect, Hood had a strong sense of his changing time. It is easy to misunderstand the nature of that change. The abstraction that characterizes the Daily News Building and the RCA Building has little to do with new technology or changing functions. Those buildings are not any more “modern” than the Chicago Tribune tower, which had gargoyles and flying buttresses but was an advanced building in terms of planning and technology. Indeed, Hood’s Gothic design was more functionally advanced than Eliel Saarinen’s stylistically progressive second-place entry. It was not commodity and firmness that drove the changing aesthetic, but fashion. The public had a taste for simpler, forward-looking design, of which the International Style was but one expression. Art Deco, streamlined modern, and stripped Classicism were evidence of the same changing taste. Many industrial products of the 1930s displayed the same chic simplicity: Raymond Loewy’s curvilinear Coldspot refrigerator, Walter Dorwin Teague’s popular Kodak Brownie camera, Henry Dreyfuss’ Bell telephone, Loewy’s redesigned Coca-Cola bottle and the sleek Zippo cigarette lighter.
The medieval inventors of the Gothic style were likewise influenced by fashion. In the twelfth century, European cathedral builders abandoned the tried-and-true round arch in favor of the pointed arch. This change cannot be explained by functional or structural requirements, since the pointed arch provides only marginal structural advantages; and round-arch technology is perfectly capable of building tall naves, as Durham Cathedral and other magnificent Romanesque churches demonstrate. Cathedral builders obviously found something delightful in the pointed arch, which they used not only as a structural form, but in window tracery, in wood paneling, and even in choir-stall furniture and liturgical accessories. “[Gothic] was seized upon as essential not because it was materially essential, but because the pointed arch struck that note of fantasy which was what the mind of the age desired,” explains John Summerson. “It willfully destroyed the discipline of the round arch, which had become an incubus and a bore.”5 A note of fantasy? A bore? At this point, the eminent architectural historian sounds like a Harper’s Bazaar fashion critic.
Architectural reputations, as well as architecture, come under fashion’s sway. Hood, Ely Jacques Kahn, and Ralph Walker (the architect of the Irving Trust Building on Wall Street), all small men, were dubbed the “Three Little Napoleons of Architecture” by The New Yorker. Riding high in the 1920s, their careers were cut short by the Depression—Hood’s more so, since he died in 1934, only 53 years old. Rockefeller Center continued to be admired by the public, but because of his freewheeling approach to design, Hood was marginalized by modernist architectural historians. He was never forgiven for winning the Chicago Tribune competition and beating not only Saarinen, but such European avant-gardists as Adolf Loos, Bruno Taut, and even Walter Gropius, the founder of the Bauhaus and the guiding light of the International Style. Yet if I compare Hood’s RCA Building with Gropius’s Pan Am (today MetLife) Building, there is little doubt who was the more creative designer.
Looking at that monolith, bestriding Park Avenue without charm or grace, it is easy to forget that Gropius was once considered one of the great architects of the twentieth century. Architectural memory can be fickle. Thomas Ustick Walter is not a household name, but it should be—he was the architect of the U.S. Capitol dome, probably one of the most powerful symbols of American democracy. The Lincoln Memorial, designed by Henry Bacon, is another famous architectural icon. Bacon died in 1924, only two years after the memorial was dedicated, so he did not see the Classicism that he had learned at McKim’s knee slip out of fashion. At least Walter and Bacon were feted during their lifetimes. Edward Durrell Stone, an International Style wunderkind, developed an unfashionable interest in decoration at a time when architectural austerity was in vogue. And although he received large commissions (including the Kennedy Center for the Arts), he finished his career ignored if not actually ridiculed. In the mid-1960s, Paul Rudolph was probably the most promising young architect in the country. His robustly monumental Art and Architecture Building at Yale, where he was also chairman, reinvigorated postwar American architecture. A decade later, heroic monumentalism was out and Postmodernism was in. Although Rudolph continued to receive commissions in Asia, he was slighted in his own country. His contemporaries Gordon Bunshaft and Kevin Roche were awarded the Pritzker Prize, but Rudolph was passed over. By the time he died in 1997, he was virtually forgotten.
Yet Rudolph, a gifted designer, may be admitted to the architectural pantheon one day. Architectural reputations can rise and fall and rise again. The nineteenth-century Philadelphia architect Frank Furness designed Ruskinian Gothic buildings whose lively eclecticism anticipates James Stirling. Furness, an exceptional individual who won a Congressional Medal of Honor during the Civil War, dominated the Philadelphia architectural scene for 20 years. In 1891 he completed the University of Pennsylvania Library, a widely acclaimed brick and terracotta building with a dramatic four-story-high reading room. After the turn-of-the-century, with Classicism all the rage, Furness’ idiosyncratic brand of architecture became unfashionable. Although he lived until 1912, his practice languished. In time he was entirely forgotten, many of his buildings were demolished, others insensitively altered. As for the library, its tall reading room was crudely truncated by a suspended ceiling. In the 1950s, there was a revival of interest in Furness, which narrowly saved the library from demolition. Today, after a careful restoration, the library is unquestionably the best-loved building on the University of Pennsylvania campus—something about the spiky decoration and the willfully manipulated forms appeals to current sensibility. Furness has found an audience again.
The fate of Rudolph and Furness is a reminder that although architecture is susceptible to fashion, architects are not fashion designers. “I do not design a new architecture every Monday morning,” Mies van der Rohe is reputed to have said. This is often taken as a reflection of his serious commitment to his art. It was that, but it was something else, too. He might as well have said, “I cannot design a new architecture every Monday morning.” The Seagram Building is a masterpiece, not because Mies had a sudden inspiration, but because he had spent decades learning how to bring commodity, firmness, and delight into his particular version of balance; how to attach the travertine to the wall to create a particular effect; which metal fabricator could make a certain kind of handrail; and exactly how deep to make a window mullion to cast the right size of shadow. Buildings are extremely complicated artifacts, and the time necessary to cultivate and refine a particular manner of building cannot be underestimated. This is especially true when the manner of building is personal or unusual, as it was in the case of both Furness and Rudolph. They were not simply being stubborn or high-minded when they refused to adapt to changing fashions, they were being realistic.
Morris Lapidus is an architect who has lived long enough to see architectural fashions come full circle. In the 1950s, Lapidus designed many of the largest hotels in the Miami area: the Fontainebleau, the Americana, the Eden Roc. His flamboyant, eclectic designs were ridiculed by the architectural establishment, although they were popular with the public. Today, in a period of so-called entertainment architecture, when the world’s most celebrated architects design theme parks and casinos, Lapidus seems less like a maverick than a pioneer. “The father of us all,” Philip Johnson called him, with only slight exaggeration.

Architecture changes at a bewildering pace. Consider only the last 50 years of museum design. The National Gallery of Art (1937-41) in Washington, D.C. and the Museum of Modern Art (1937-39) in New York City are almost exact contemporaries. In the MoMA design, Philip L. Goodwin and Edward Durrell Stone ignored the Classical tradition represented by John Russell Pope’s masterpiece. MoMA’s entrance was not up a broad flight of exterior steps but through a revolving door. Goodwin and Stone replaced the monumental rotunda by a nondescript lobby, the lofty galleries by low-ceilinged loft spaces, and limestone and marble by stucco and plasterboard. MoMA was to be the last word in avant-garde International Style, but it was scarcely finished when it was challenged by Frank Lloyd Wright’s Guggenheim Museum (1943-58), which rejected the banality of the white box by squeezing the entire museum into a dramatic sculptural spiral. Nothing could be further from the International Style than the mollusk-like exterior (especially if it had been tinted rose-red, as Wright initially wanted). In the Yale Center for British Art (1969-77), Louis I. Kahn likewise incorporated central skylit spaces, but he disavowed Wright’s loud anti-urban exterior by hugging the sidewalk and clothing his building in drab stainless steel panels. Kahn preached taming technology by consigning it to so-called servant spaces; in the Centre Georges Pompidou (1971-77), Piano and Rogers stood Kahn’s dictum on its head and gave the servants the run of the house. In the Neue Staatsgalerie (1977-83), James Stirling cheekily lifted architectural elements from both the Pompidou and the Guggenheim and combined them with a variety of historical styles. I. M. Pei’s impeccably crafted East Building of the National Gallery of Art (1976-78) in Washington, D.C., had not one exposed bolt, not one allusion to the past. Pei rejected both Stirling’s eclecticism and Piano and Rogers’ technological posturing. Instead he relied on abstract geometry for architectural effect. Frank O. Gehry’s California Aerospace Museum (1982-84) in Los Angeles is no less abstract and geometrical, but his forms bump and grind into each other almost as if by accident. “I really enjoy the awkwardness with which [the forms] touch,” Gehry observed, “as it reminds me of the cities we live in and the kind of awkwardnesses of city buildings sitting next to each other.”6 The cost of the East Building was $94.4 million; the Aerospace Museum was built on a tight budget of only $3.4 million. Lacking money for refinement, Gehry turned awkwardness into a virtue, and in the process disowned Pei’s fastidious brand of modernism. He was carefree where Pei was careful, spontaneous where Pei was studied, brash where Pei was genteel. The Aerospace Museum was clearly not a cheaper version of the East Building, it was something different.
“Fashion is also a search for a new language to discredit the old,” writes Fernand Braudel, “a way in which each generation can repudiate its immediate predecessor and distinguish itself from it.”7 This puts fashion in the right light: it may be fleeting, but it is not frivolous. As Braudel suggests, changes in fashion imply not only the creation of something new, but the destruction of something old. That is why new fashions are inevitably upsetting. Whether one is wearing a lounge-suit instead of a frock coat, or turning a baseball cap backwards, someone else is bound to be insulted. No less so in architecture. Replacing an Ionic column with a steel I-beam, or exposing air-conditioning ducts, or using common materials in uncommon ways are calculated affronts to honored conventions. “We are not like our fathers,” the architects say, “we are different.”

Amsterdam and its people
There’s no other city on earth like Amsterdam. It is a city of superlatives, having more canals than Venice and more bridges than Paris. It is also one of the prettiest in Europe. The more than 50 museums — featuring everything from the worlds most prominent artists, to the history of hemp — quench the thirst for even the most ardent culture buff, and with 6,000 buildings from the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, the reflections of its illustrious history happily ripple on into the 21st century. However, the lure of Amsterdam’s bricks and mortar is only part of its excitement. Its contemporary culture is vibrant — it’s definitely not a city stuck in the past, and the people are open-minded, easygoing, and opinionated but also down to earth and welcoming to visitors.
Amsterdam is situated in the north of The Netherlands and was set where the outlet of the Amstel River meets the salty tidal waters of the Zuider Zee. With little dry land to build on, exactly why a small group of settlers chose this unpromising spot is difficult to understand. Yet it proved to be an excellent decision because Amsterdammers (as the natives of Amsterdam are called) soon came to control the waters of the river, and the trade which flowed along it. By the 17th century, Amsterdam had become arguably the richest city in the world, at the center of a huge Dutch colonial empire. It traded in spices, rum, and sugar cane among other commodities, and its residents demanded only the best. The Amsterdam of this period — called the Golden Age — forms the heart of today’s city.
Without doubt, the initial lure of the city is its numerous historic buildings. The lines of tall, narrow houses with their pretty gables rest beside picture-perfect tree-lined canals. They are connected by ornate iron bridges and cobbled walkways, which have changed little for over 300 years, in fact, since they felt the footfall of such inhabitants as the artist Rembrandt and explorer Abel Tasman, who gave his name to Tasmania.
Amsterdam is a wonderful city for visitors. Small enough to stroll around, and with the canal side streets too narrow for tour buses, you can’t drive past all the best attractions at high speed. Here, there is no glass window between you and reality. You have to feel the summer sun, or see your breath on a crisp winter morning as you step out to see what Amsterdam is all about. If you take a canal tour, the quiet boats allow you to float slowly along, away from the noise of the modern world.
The museums could keep you busy for weeks. Art collections, historic houses, and memorials to heroes and heroines can all be found here. For entertainment after the sun sets, there are over 40 different performances in the city every evening. The Netherlands National Opera and National Ballet are based here, and there are numerous orchestral, musical, and comedy venues, along with revues and dance shows. Amsterdam also plays host to one of the most dynamic club scenes in Europe, with several major venues drawing thousands of young people to the city.
Yet if the façades of the buildings hark back to the past, the interiors do not. Internet banking, interactive information points, and resource recycling advice centers — the concepts of today are alive and thriving all around the city. This is no historic ghost town, the city brims with people. Its houses are still lived in (although most are now apartments rather than single-family homes), and its streets filled with bakeries, delicatessens, and wine merchants where people drop in to buy dinner on the way home in the evenings. It’s all part of the fascinating dichotomy you find at every turn here. The city strides into the future while still holding hands with the past.
The historic heart of Amsterdam has remained unchanged mainly because of people power. As in most cities in the world, during the second part of the 20th century property developers eyed the old canal houses with relish. The price of land was soaring, and developers could make a tidy profit by demolishing them and replacing them with something modern. Unfashionable buildings, such as the warehouses of the old docks, were simply left to the elements, deemed to be worthless. Amsterdammers, though, had other ideas. They went out onto the streets to fight for their city, barricading historic houses and occupying empty buildings in the warehouse district.
This was typical of the populace, and it wasn’t the first time; in fact Amsterdammers have been standing up for what they believe in for centuries. When Protestants were persecuted in the 16th century, they flocked here from all around Europe to take refuge. During WWII, the dock workers of Amsterdam went on strike as an act of protest against the treatment of the Jews in the city. Although in the end the protest was futile, it shows the strength of feeling and social awareness that pervades every part of society here. As the 21st century begins, Amsterdam has over 100 different nationalities living within the city boundaries, a situation which could be fraught with difficulty and strain. Yet here it only adds to the cultural richness built up over centuries of exploration and trade.
Amsterdammers seem to have the ability to find creative solutions to the problems of their world. When there wasn’t enough housing on the land, they looked at the empty canals and decided that houseboats would help. There are now over 2,500 on the waterways of the city. When cars became a problem in the old town they gave the bicycle priority, and now there are over 1,000,000 on the streets — and an estimated 30,000 at the bottom of the canal system at any one time! You’ll quickly learn to listen for the warning bells and stand clear as their riders pedal by.
Perhaps the most widely publicized acts of tolerance in recent history have been in the areas of sex and drugs. Amsterdammers looked at feasible and practical responses to the issues, and decriminalized some aspects of both. This does not make the city one huge den of iniquity and these areas are still controlled and regulated; in fact, you could visit Amsterdam and be quite unaware of these activities. There’s just a recognition here that provided no harm comes to you or others around you, then you should be free, as an adult, to make your own choices.
Amsterdammers fight for everyone’s rights against oppression, or the right of David to stand against the faceless Goliath of bureaucracy. In fact in Amsterdam several thousand Davids get together to form a pressure group, and Goliath has to sit up and take notice. This doesn’t mean that Amsterdam is utopia — it is a city of 21st-century pressures, particularly with continuing problems of traffic and litter — but it does mean that the problems are faced realistically, debated passionately by the whole community, and agreed solutions are put into action. When the solutions don’t work (as they often don’t) the whole process starts over again. It is all seen as part of a huge learning curve.
Of course, Amsterdammers don’t spend all their time waving protest banners. They are as industrious and hardworking as their forefathers. They enjoy galleries and exhibitions as much as the visitors do — in fact it can be very hard to get tickets for performances because of local demand. On weekends they head to the parks to picnic, or out of the city in large groups to do more cycling. They eat out in restaurants and cafés — where they have over 50 different types of cuisine to choose from. They love to socialize, and bars — particularly the famous “brown bars” — are the place where they meet, usually to put the world to rights. In summer they sit out with a drink as bar owners put out tables in the squares and on street corners. Sit at a table and you’ll soon find yourself engaged in conversation (most Amsterdammers speak good English). Within an hour you’ll feel like a local.
Amsterdam has many facets, almost as many as the diamonds for which the city is famous. Yet these seem to amalgamate into a coherent whole. It is a city of history, which shouts from every gable and street corner; a city of culture — of museums, and musicians, and artists; a city of learning with a large university; a city of trade with banking at its core; a multi-ethnic city of over 100 different nationalities; a city of “live and let live” as minority groups are able to flourish and innovative ideas to develop; and of course, a city of tourism, with over 32 million visitors per year. The beauty of its buildings is undisputed, but it is the sum of all these parts that makes Amsterdam an unforgettable city to visit.







Athens and
The Athenians
M ention the name Athens and almost everyone will have some preconceived ideas about the city. Socrates painted a picture with words in the fourth century b.c., Pausanais during the Roman era. In the 20th century, Hollywood added its own slant to the legends, and every school child learns about the gods of the ancient Greek world — of Zeus, Athena, and Apollo.
The most important city in the world during its heyday in the fifth and fourth centuries b.c., the people of Athens were highly sophisticated in their thoughts and actions, their tastes and fashions. This small city set on and around a dramatic hill of rock — the Acropolis — became the cradle of western civilization. From the public meetings held here the concepts of citizenship, democracy, and debate developed. Through their regard for learning, history and science were first codified and organized. The Athenian love of leisure allowed the development of numerous pursuits such as theater — imagine a world without tragedy or comedy (without the ancient Athenians, the much-loved TV soap opera might never have been possible). They also admired sporting prowess, inaugurating the Olympic Games where the best in the world would compete together simply for the glory of winning. 
Athenians left an enduring legacy of concepts and ideas for humankind but they also bequeathed a remarkable number of buildings and artifacts that tell us about their lives. The remains of the temples of the Acropolis are recognized worldwide and hundreds of statues, along with ordinary household pottery, jewelry, and tools hold a fascination for anyone who enjoys exploring the past.
However, the city of Athens is more than a sum of these ancient parts. Though it disappeared from the record books following the decline of the Roman Empire in the fifth century — its lineage and magnificent monuments unappreciated — it has risen like a phoenix from the ashes since 1834, the year that it became capital of the modern country of Greece. 
Grand buildings were erected to mark its re-birth. Though Neo-Classical design was fashionable everywhere in Europe in the mid-19th century, in Athens it echoed that of the original monuments of the ancient city — it was, in a sense, returning home. The elegant simplicity of the Parliament building, graceful façade of the University, and almost ‘Rococo-esque’ decoration on the Academy all hark back to ancient antecedents. Each was built with marble hewn from the Pentelic Hills just as those erected in Athens at the time of Socrates. 
But there was a downside to this sudden re-emergence to center stage. People were drawn to the new capital like bees to a honey-pot, and throughout the 19th century the dispossessed of the economically floundering Aegean islands flocked here to find work. In the 1920s in the aftermath of WWII and the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Greece and Turkey agreed on a mass population swap, and millions of Greeks whose families had lived in Asia Minor (on the western Turkish coast) for generations, found themselves homeless in their spiritual homeland. Athens strained to accommodate many of them and a rash of building work saw the erection of the first faceless utilitarian suburbs that now surround the downtown area. Since buildings were kept low-rise in an attempt to make them earthquake proof, Athens began to spread outwards across the olive groves of nearby valleys. Not one of the world’s prettiest cities, its preponderance for concrete can give it a drab and shabby look even on the brightest of days.
In the latter years of the 20th century very little was done to improve matters. The population grew but the infrastructure was not developed, resulting in gridlock of the urban traffic system, smog, and noise pollution. Today, at first glance nothing seems to have changed. A brown layer of pollution hangs over the city in both hot and cold weather; the seemingly endless hooting of horns down the wide boulevards and the drone of vehicles making painfully slow progress through the narrow streets raises noise levels; and in a city with so many apartments and so little parking it’s no surprise that sidewalks become places to leave your vehicle, and pedestrians must risk life and limb by walking on the roads. 
Perhaps this picture seems a little bleak, but there is one positive factor that eases the concern about visiting Athens. It’s so easy to escape the city completely that one needn’t feel trapped by the urban environment. Within an hour of being at Syntagma Square outside the National Parliament building (the symbolic heart of the city), you could easily be sitting at the quayside of some small Greek island having a cooling drink, or enjoying the pine forest of the countryside of Attica — the region that surrounds the capital. 
Athenians understand this. They are not daunted or downhearted by their surroundings, they enjoy their city, revelling in the opportunities it gives them. Every district has its own small squares with cafés, where people gather for a drink or meal — and Athenians love to eat out. You’ll be surprised at the wealth of good restaurants offering international cuisine, and how much post-modernist décor influences interior design in the smarter districts. Of course the Greek taverna hasn’t become extinct. Locals as much as visitors enjoy the fresh and delicious cuisine that’s been served in Greece for centuries. Greek theater is thriving at new auditoria such as the Megaron complex, or at the open-air theaters on Lycabettus Hill. The annual Athens Festival has a full program of music, dance, and poetry with a rich historical legacy. Sports are still avidly followed, though today it’s more likely to be football, not a discus throw, that excites the emotions. Powerboat racing out on the waters of the Saronic Gulf also raises the adrenalin of the wealthy.
Tradition still plays an important part in daily life here. The family forms the backbone of Greek society and filial ties are strong. Children play safely in the streets with grandma keeping a watchful eye. New babies are proudly shown to the world in the evening volta or stroll, when neighbors come to “bill and coo.” Families gather for a weekend meal, taking over a corner of a taverna to spend a couple of hours in noisy debate (some may say argument) while perhaps having a little food. Eating always takes second place to conversation at a Greek meal. Greek hospitality is warm and genuine — even small examples such as always being welcomed with a smile and shown to your seats at a taverna. Shopkeepers are skilled salesmen, but never pushy or overbearing. 
The Orthodox Church — for so long the one thing that united the Hellenic Diaspora — still has a strong influence on the population. Everyone from suited businessmen to young soldiers on national service make a regular visit to Athens Cathedral or a small local church to light a candle. People stop in on the way home from work or in their lunch breaks; it’s such a normal part of everyday life here. The Greek language also unifies the congregation with the clergy and Greeks around the world, though its use gives the capital a decidedly exotic air as visitors struggle to make sense of these “foreign” letters. There’s also a sense of patriotism and national pride here even among the young — perhaps brought about by political upheavals in the late 20th century. Since Greek democracy was restored in 1975, after the military dictatorship, it is as though the population relish their country all the more.
However, since joining the European Union (then the Common Market) in 1981, Greece has definitely moved closer to her western cousins, being one of the first wave of countries to join the Euro currency zone. The government in Athens has done well out of her union, receiving billions of dollars in aid, which has been used to upgrade vital road links throughout the country. Though the economy is still troubled, you are just as likely to see mobile phones as worry beads in a man’s hand, and the young wear the latest European fashions just as the Italians and French do. 
Tourism also continues to flourish at the dawn of the 21st century. It is Greece’s major foreign currency earner with 11 million people visiting every year. Athens is an international melting pot with people of many nationalities treading the marble steps of the Acropolis to gaze at the birthplace of Western civilization. In 2004 the Olympic Games, first held in Greece during ancient times, will return to the capital giving Athens the chance to stand in the limelight again. The city offers some of the most fascinating and alluring archaeological remains in the world, yet those who visit in the 21st century find that the modern city works hard to live up to the past.







The Bahamas and the Bahamians
Like a handful of emeralds scattered across blue velvet, the verdant islands of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas stretch across 100,000 sq miles (259,000 sq km) of the Atlantic Ocean. The 700 islands and numerous smaller cays (pronounced “keys”) that comprise this semitropical archipelago start 55 miles (90 km) east of Palm Beach, Florida, and arc 600 miles (970 km) southeast toward eastern Cuba and Haiti, like a series of stepping stones linking North America with the Caribbean.
Some of the islands are only a few hundred square meters in size, but together they make up an area of 5,380 sq miles (14,000 sq km), slightly smaller than the area of the Hawaiian Islands. Only 100 of the islands are inhabited; many of these have become private playgrounds for the rich and super-rich. Even fewer — 37 to be exact — have settlements or towns. This leaves many hundreds of cays that are totally natural, untouched by the destructive influence of humans and offering pristine habitats to hundreds of bird and animal species.
The Bahamas islands are the flattened peaks of a huge ancient mountain range that once towered many thousands of feet into the sky. They now lie low in the water, the highest point — Mount Alvernia on Cat Island — being only 206 ft (65 m) above sea level. The eastern coastlines of the islands break the long tidal fetch that travels across the Atlantic; on the sheltered western coastline, coral outcrops have produced vast shallow sand banks that reflect waters of myriad translucent blues and greens.
Indeed, it was these characteristic shallow banks that gave the Bahamas islands their name. When Spanish explorers came to map the area in the 16th century, they named the area baja mar, or shallow seas, as a warning to the galleons that would be sailing through the waters. The name was later anglicized and the Bahamas were born.
The warning on Spanish maps unfortunately did little to stop ships from running aground or foundering on the treacherous shoals; even today treasure lost centuries ago is still being discovered and salvaged.
The islands of the Bahamas were claimed by the English, but hundreds of secret coves became home to pirates and smugglers who turned their backs on nationality to enter the brotherhood of buccaneers. They ruled the seas, plundering ships at will, and then spent their ill-gotten gains in the bars and brothels of Nassau town, the main settlement.
Later, as the English colonies of North America fought for independence, the islands became a refuge for fleeing loyalists who sought to make a new life on these remote, picturesque cays. Cotton production brought a number of slaves to the islands, but the crops proved to be poor and depleted the already weak soil. Sponge gathering was devastated after a fungus attacked the crop, and sisal was produced more cheaply in South America. The population eked out a living, but little more than that. Things changed in the 1920s, however, when the Bahamas profited from the American policy of Prohibition. Rum-running became a major industry, and well-to-do Americans began making the short trip to the Bahamas to be able to drink legally, and to indulge in other pleasures.
Since World War II, the Bahamas has worked hard to extend the service it provided during Prohibition and has turned itself into a “paradise” for holiday-makers. The dazzling beaches are covered with fine sand that ranges from bright white to pastel pink. The sun shines year-round, with temperatures ranging from the high 60s to the high 80s fahrenheit. To these natural ingredients have been added just about every amenity and service needed for the perfect holiday. Everything centers on New Providence, where most of the tourists stay and half of the Bahamian population lives. One of the largest cruise ports in the world, Nassau can accommodate 15 large ships at one time. English “pomp,” stout forts, and colonial houses attract history buffs. Grand Bahama, the second most populous island, has Freeport–Lucaya, Nassau’s younger, less genteel “American” cousin; nightlife here is more lavish and audacious than in Nassau. Both islands have large resort hotels that offer water-sports, floor shows, and casinos where you can enjoy the thrill of winning or the dejection of losing. Golf courses entice you to lower your handicap. Tour buses plow a path around the attractions, and duty-free shops tempt you to buy that little luxury item you’ve been denying yourself for so long. Hundreds of day-trippers cruise to both islands, eager to do it all before they have to get back on the boat.
On the smaller and more remote islands — called the Out Islands or Family Islands — intimate resorts cater to your every need and make it possible for you to forget about schedules, deadlines, and traffic jams. The most difficult decision you’ll have to make is what to pick from the extensive dinner menu. While the clubs and casinos may not play on into the night, during the day you’ll be worn out by walks along the beach and other strenuous activities, such as collecting sea shells, enjoying long lunches, and applying sunblock. The whole trip could prove to be exhausting!
The lure of the Bahamas is, of course, as much about the sea as it is about the land. The waters of the western Atlantic are still some of the clearest and most beautiful in the world. In summer the shallows are glassy still and range from azure blue to emerald green; the deep ocean channels reflect a deep blue that can best be appreciated from the air. The sandy shallows are ideal for swimming and snorkeling, and since the development of scuba (an acronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) gear in the 1930s, the seas around the Bahamas have become a top destination for diving enthusiasts from around the world. 
The waters of the Bahamas support a vast range of life and contain 5 percent of the world’s coral. Diving around the reef surfaces and the vertical reef walls is complemented by many ship wrecks and artificial sites — large, concrete blocks which are placed on the sea bed to encourage coral growth — surrounding the islands. Fish species mass in the vast shallows along with urchins and starfish. Yet deep ocean channels cut between some island groups — the Tongue of the Ocean between Andros and New Providence, for example, is 6,000 ft (2,000 m) deep — and these provide a thoroughfare for a number of large fish and marine mammal species, such as sharks, rays, dolphins, and turtles.
This not only provides excitement for divers, who can watch shark feeding in the wild on some Bahamian islands, but also to fishermen. The vast numbers of large fish species, including record breaking marlin and bonefish, make for some of the most challenging and thrilling sport-fishing in the world.
On top of the water, the shallow channels and sheltered seas provide ideal waters for sailing and cruising. Hundreds of unmanned cays offer idyllic destinations and mooring points. The desert island you always dreamed about is somewhere in the Bahamas — the Exumas themselves have one cay for every day of year, and that is only one part of the vast Commonwealth. Many lie only a few hours sailing time from the hubbub of Nassau.
The Bahamian people are among the friendliest you’ll ever meet, and they are eager to share the homeland they love with visitors. The population is a fascinating mixture of descendants of the Loyalist settlers who left America after the American Revolution, freedom lovers who escaped religious persecution, and ex-slaves set free following emancipation. This mixture, which could have produced a society fraught with problems, has evolved into a gentle, sociable, and happy people, proud of their homeland and the progress they have made since independence in 1973. With a stable economy, good health, and no taxes, it’s no wonder that a smile comes naturally to all Bahamians. All the communities still have strong religious faith, the pretty churches are full on Sundays, and a conversation about some future event always ends with “…God willing” or “…with the Lord’s blessing.”
To make the most of your trip you’ll need to tune your mind to “Bahamian time.” On New Providence and Grand Bahama this may not be much slower than at home, but on the Out Islands, time definitely runs more slowly, and nothing is so important that it can’t wait a while. People are more important than to-do lists, so a leisurely exchange of greetings and an inquiry about your family’s well-being precedes any business activity. This genuine thoughtfulness also extends to visitors; someone will always go out of their way to be helpful, in ways that have been lost in more developed locations.
Every island has its own individual character, forged by a unique history and development, in fact the Bahamas could be said to be several different holiday experiences in one country, so it’s important to choose your island carefully to get the kind of holiday you want.

Amsterdam and its people
There’s no other city on earth like Amsterdam. It is a city of superlatives, having more canals than Venice and more bridges than Paris. It is also one of the prettiest in Europe. The more than 50 museums — featuring everything from the worlds most prominent artists, to the history of hemp — quench the thirst for even the most ardent culture buff, and with 6,000 buildings from the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, the reflections of its illustrious history happily ripple on into the 21st century. However, the lure of Amsterdam’s bricks and mortar is only part of its excitement. Its contemporary culture is vibrant — it’s definitely not a city stuck in the past, and the people are open-minded, easygoing, and opinionated but also down to earth and welcoming to visitors.
Amsterdam is situated in the north of The Netherlands and was set where the outlet of the Amstel River meets the salty tidal waters of the Zuider Zee. With little dry land to build on, exactly why a small group of settlers chose this unpromising spot is difficult to understand. Yet it proved to be an excellent decision because Amsterdammers (as the natives of Amsterdam are called) soon came to control the waters of the river, and the trade which flowed along it. By the 17th century, Amsterdam had become arguably the richest city in the world, at the center of a huge Dutch colonial empire. It traded in spices, rum, and sugar cane among other commodities, and its residents demanded only the best. The Amsterdam of this period — called the Golden Age — forms the heart of today’s city.
Without doubt, the initial lure of the city is its numerous historic buildings. The lines of tall, narrow houses with their pretty gables rest beside picture-perfect tree-lined canals. They are connected by ornate iron bridges and cobbled walkways, which have changed little for over 300 years, in fact, since they felt the footfall of such inhabitants as the artist Rembrandt and explorer Abel Tasman, who gave his name to Tasmania.
Amsterdam is a wonderful city for visitors. Small enough to stroll around, and with the canal side streets too narrow for tour buses, you can’t drive past all the best attractions at high speed. Here, there is no glass window between you and reality. You have to feel the summer sun, or see your breath on a crisp winter morning as you step out to see what Amsterdam is all about. If you take a canal tour, the quiet boats allow you to float slowly along, away from the noise of the modern world.
The museums could keep you busy for weeks. Art collections, historic houses, and memorials to heroes and heroines can all be found here. For entertainment after the sun sets, there are over 40 different performances in the city every evening. The Netherlands National Opera and National Ballet are based here, and there are numerous orchestral, musical, and comedy venues, along with revues and dance shows. Amsterdam also plays host to one of the most dynamic club scenes in Europe, with several major venues drawing thousands of young people to the city.
Yet if the façades of the buildings hark back to the past, the interiors do not. Internet banking, interactive information points, and resource recycling advice centers — the concepts of today are alive and thriving all around the city. This is no historic ghost town, the city brims with people. Its houses are still lived in (although most are now apartments rather than single-family homes), and its streets filled with bakeries, delicatessens, and wine merchants where people drop in to buy dinner on the way home in the evenings. It’s all part of the fascinating dichotomy you find at every turn here. The city strides into the future while still holding hands with the past.
The historic heart of Amsterdam has remained unchanged mainly because of people power. As in most cities in the world, during the second part of the 20th century property developers eyed the old canal houses with relish. The price of land was soaring, and developers could make a tidy profit by demolishing them and replacing them with something modern. Unfashionable buildings, such as the warehouses of the old docks, were simply left to the elements, deemed to be worthless. Amsterdammers, though, had other ideas. They went out onto the streets to fight for their city, barricading historic houses and occupying empty buildings in the warehouse district.
This was typical of the populace, and it wasn’t the first time; in fact Amsterdammers have been standing up for what they believe in for centuries. When Protestants were persecuted in the 16th century, they flocked here from all around Europe to take refuge. During WWII, the dock workers of Amsterdam went on strike as an act of protest against the treatment of the Jews in the city. Although in the end the protest was futile, it shows the strength of feeling and social awareness that pervades every part of society here. As the 21st century begins, Amsterdam has over 100 different nationalities living within the city boundaries, a situation which could be fraught with difficulty and strain. Yet here it only adds to the cultural richness built up over centuries of exploration and trade.
Amsterdammers seem to have the ability to find creative solutions to the problems of their world. When there wasn’t enough housing on the land, they looked at the empty canals and decided that houseboats would help. There are now over 2,500 on the waterways of the city. When cars became a problem in the old town they gave the bicycle priority, and now there are over 1,000,000 on the streets — and an estimated 30,000 at the bottom of the canal system at any one time! You’ll quickly learn to listen for the warning bells and stand clear as their riders pedal by.
Perhaps the most widely publicized acts of tolerance in recent history have been in the areas of sex and drugs. Amsterdammers looked at feasible and practical responses to the issues, and decriminalized some aspects of both. This does not make the city one huge den of iniquity and these areas are still controlled and regulated; in fact, you could visit Amsterdam and be quite unaware of these activities. There’s just a recognition here that provided no harm comes to you or others around you, then you should be free, as an adult, to make your own choices.
Amsterdammers fight for everyone’s rights against oppression, or the right of David to stand against the faceless Goliath of bureaucracy. In fact in Amsterdam several thousand Davids get together to form a pressure group, and Goliath has to sit up and take notice. This doesn’t mean that Amsterdam is utopia — it is a city of 21st-century pressures, particularly with continuing problems of traffic and litter — but it does mean that the problems are faced realistically, debated passionately by the whole community, and agreed solutions are put into action. When the solutions don’t work (as they often don’t) the whole process starts over again. It is all seen as part of a huge learning curve.
Of course, Amsterdammers don’t spend all their time waving protest banners. They are as industrious and hardworking as their forefathers. They enjoy galleries and exhibitions as much as the visitors do — in fact it can be very hard to get tickets for performances because of local demand. On weekends they head to the parks to picnic, or out of the city in large groups to do more cycling. They eat out in restaurants and cafés — where they have over 50 different types of cuisine to choose from. They love to socialize, and bars — particularly the famous “brown bars” — are the place where they meet, usually to put the world to rights. In summer they sit out with a drink as bar owners put out tables in the squares and on street corners. Sit at a table and you’ll soon find yourself engaged in conversation (most Amsterdammers speak good English). Within an hour you’ll feel like a local.
Amsterdam has many facets, almost as many as the diamonds for which the city is famous. Yet these seem to amalgamate into a coherent whole. It is a city of history, which shouts from every gable and street corner; a city of culture — of museums, and musicians, and artists; a city of learning with a large university; a city of trade with banking at its core; a multi-ethnic city of over 100 different nationalities; a city of “live and let live” as minority groups are able to flourish and innovative ideas to develop; and of course, a city of tourism, with over 32 million visitors per year. The beauty of its buildings is undisputed, but it is the sum of all these parts that makes Amsterdam an unforgettable city to visit.

Athens is an international melting pot with people of many nationalities treading the marble steps of the Acropolis to gaze at the birthplace of Western civilization. In 2004 the Olympic Games, first held in Greece during ancient times, will return to the capital giving Athens the chance to stand in the limelight again. The city offers some of the most fascinating and alluring archaeological remains in the world, yet those who visit in the 21st century find that the modern city works hard to live up to the past.







The Bahamas and the Bahamians
Like a handful of emeralds scattered across blue velvet, the verdant islands of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas stretch across 100,000 sq miles (259,000 sq km) of the Atlantic Ocean. The 700 islands and numerous smaller cays (pronounced “keys”) that comprise this semitropical archipelago start 55 miles (90 km) east of Palm Beach, Florida, and arc 600 miles (970 km) southeast toward eastern Cuba and Haiti, like a series of stepping stones linking North America with the Caribbean.
Some of the islands are only a few hundred square meters in size, but together they make up an area of 5,380 sq miles (14,000 sq km), slightly smaller than the area of the Hawaiian Islands. Only 100 of the islands are inhabited; many of these have become private playgrounds for the rich and super-rich. Even fewer — 37 to be exact — have settlements or towns. This leaves many hundreds of cays that are totally natural, untouched by the destructive influence of humans and offering pristine habitats to hundreds of bird and animal species.
The Bahamas islands are the flattened peaks of a huge ancient mountain range that once towered many thousands of feet into the sky. They now lie low in the water, the highest point — Mount Alvernia on Cat Island — being only 206 ft (65 m) above sea level. The eastern coastlines of the islands break the long tidal fetch that travels across the Atlantic; on the sheltered western coastline, coral outcrops have produced vast shallow sand banks that reflect waters of myriad translucent blues and greens.
Indeed, it was these characteristic shallow banks that gave the Bahamas islands their name. When Spanish explorers came to map the area in the 16th century, they named the area baja mar, or shallow seas, as a warning to the galleons that would be sailing through the waters. The name was later anglicized and the Bahamas were born.
The warning on Spanish maps unfortunately did little to stop ships from running aground or foundering on the treacherous shoals; even today treasure lost centuries ago is still being discovered and salvaged.
The islands of the Bahamas were claimed by the English, but hundreds of secret coves became home to pirates and smugglers who turned their backs on nationality to enter the brotherhood of buccaneers. They ruled the seas, plundering ships at will, and then spent their ill-gotten gains in the bars and brothels of Nassau town, the main settlement.
Later, as the English colonies of North America fought for independence, the islands became a refuge for fleeing loyalists who sought to make a new life on these remote, picturesque cays. Cotton production brought a number of slaves to the islands, but the crops proved to be poor and depleted the already weak soil. Sponge gathering was devastated after a fungus attacked the crop, and sisal was produced more cheaply in South America. The population eked out a living, but little more than that. Things changed in the 1920s, however, when the Bahamas profited from the American policy of Prohibition. Rum-running became a major industry, and well-to-do Americans began making the short trip to the Bahamas to be able to drink legally, and to indulge in other pleasures.
Since World War II, the Bahamas has worked hard to extend the service it provided during Prohibition and has turned itself into a “paradise” for holiday-makers. The dazzling beaches are covered with fine sand that ranges from bright white to pastel pink. The sun shines year-round, with temperatures ranging from the high 60s to the high 80s fahrenheit. To these natural ingredients have been added just about every amenity and service needed for the perfect holiday. Everything centers on New Providence, where most of the tourists stay and half of the Bahamian population lives. One of the largest cruise ports in the world, Nassau can accommodate 15 large ships at one time. English “pomp,” stout forts, and colonial houses attract history buffs. Grand Bahama, the second most populous island, has Freeport–Lucaya, Nassau’s younger, less genteel “American” cousin; nightlife here is more lavish and audacious than in Nassau. Both islands have large resort hotels that offer water-sports, floor shows, and casinos where you can enjoy the thrill of winning or the dejection of losing. Golf courses entice you to lower your handicap. Tour buses plow a path around the attractions, and duty-free shops tempt you to buy that little luxury item you’ve been denying yourself for so long. Hundreds of day-trippers cruise to both islands, eager to do it all before they have to get back on the boat.
On the smaller and more remote islands — called the Out Islands or Family Islands — intimate resorts cater to your every need and make it possible for you to forget about schedules, deadlines, and traffic jams. The most difficult decision you’ll have to make is what to pick from the extensive dinner menu. While the clubs and casinos may not play on into the night, during the day you’ll be worn out by walks along the beach and other strenuous activities, such as collecting sea shells, enjoying long lunches, and applying sunblock. The whole trip could prove to be exhausting!
The lure of the Bahamas is, of course, as much about the sea as it is about the land. The waters of the western Atlantic are still some of the clearest and most beautiful in the world. In summer the shallows are glassy still and range from azure blue to emerald green; the deep ocean channels reflect a deep blue that can best be appreciated from the air. The sandy shallows are ideal for swimming and snorkeling, and since the development of scuba (an acronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) gear in the 1930s, the seas around the Bahamas have become a top destination for diving enthusiasts from around the world. 
The waters of the Bahamas support a vast range of life and contain 5 percent of the world’s coral. Diving around the reef surfaces and the vertical reef walls is complemented by many ship wrecks and artificial sites — large, concrete blocks which are placed on the sea bed to encourage coral growth — surrounding the islands. Fish species mass in the vast shallows along with urchins and starfish. Yet deep ocean channels cut between some island groups — the Tongue of the Ocean between Andros and New Providence, for example, is 6,000 ft (2,000 m) deep — and these provide a thoroughfare for a number of large fish and marine mammal species, such as sharks, rays, dolphins, and turtles.
This not only provides excitement for divers, who can watch shark feeding in the wild on some Bahamian islands, but also to fishermen. The vast numbers of large fish species, including record breaking marlin and bonefish, make for some of the most challenging and thrilling sport-fishing in the world.
On top of the water, the shallow channels and sheltered seas provide ideal waters for sailing and cruising. Hundreds of unmanned cays offer idyllic destinations and mooring points. The desert island you always dreamed about is somewhere in the Bahamas — the Exumas themselves have one cay for every day of year, and that is only one part of the vast Commonwealth. Many lie only a few hours sailing time from the hubbub of Nassau.
The Bahamian people are among the friendliest you’ll ever meet, and they are eager to share the homeland they love with visitors. The population is a fascinating mixture of descendants of the Loyalist settlers who left America after the American Revolution, freedom lovers who escaped religious persecution, and ex-slaves set free following emancipation. This mixture, which could have produced a society fraught with problems, has evolved into a gentle, sociable, and happy people, proud of their homeland and the progress they have made since independence in 1973. With a stable economy, good health, and no taxes, it’s no wonder that a smile comes naturally to all Bahamians. All the communities still have strong religious faith, the pretty churches are full on Sundays, and a conversation about some future event always ends with “…God willing” or “…with the Lord’s blessing.”
To make the most of your trip you’ll need to tune your mind to “Bahamian time.” On New Providence and Grand Bahama this may not be much slower than at home, but on the Out Islands, time definitely runs more slowly, and nothing is so important that it can’t wait a while. People are more important than to-do lists, so a leisurely exchange of greetings and an inquiry about your family’s well-being precedes any business activity. This genuine thoughtfulness also extends to visitors; someone will always go out of their way to be helpful, in ways that have been lost in more developed locations.
Every island has its own individual character, forged by a unique history and development, in fact the Bahamas could be said to be several different holiday experiences in one country, so it’s important to choose your island carefully to get the kind of holiday you want.







the ALGARVE andITS People
For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses.
And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal’s southern province is one of Europe’s premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel.
Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away.
Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular.
Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it’s not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here.
The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you’ll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks. Near Cabo de São Vicente and Sagres, the extreme western point, the terrain is surprisingly barren and the facilities decidedly low-key. The ocean can also be forbiddingly cold.
Tourist resorts clutter the entire middle of the coast, from Lagos to Faro, with a spectrum of homes away from home — monster high-rises to low-rider villas — spilling across the rolling hills and lining the beaches. Resorts like Portimão, Albufeira and Vilamoura would appear to have little room left to grow, yet tourist facilities seem to mate with each other and reproduce overnight. Much of the unstoppable growth is crass and frighteningly commercial, and the crowds in summer unbearable.
The eastern third of the Algarve is a more sedate marriage of coast and ocean, with warm waters and hot sands stretching past the wetlands of Ria Formosa to the Spanish border. The Algarve’s most picturesque town, Tavira, is along this section of the coast.
Away from the coast, the terrain slopes through pines, mimosa, eucalyptus, and heather to an altitude of nearly 915 m (3,000 ft). Vacationers wishing to escape the maddening beach crowds can run for the hills, especially the tantalizing Serra de Monchique.
The region’s exotic name is derived from the Arabic,Al-Gharb, meaning “country of the west.” The westernmost territory of Europe was highly prized by North African Moors, who occupied it from the eighth to the 13th centuries. Their half millennium here left indelible traces, seen today in whitewashed houses, hilltop castles, and colorful ceramic tiles.
Following the Reconquest of Iberia by Christians, the Algarve led Portugal to glory and fortune. Prince Henry the Navigator established his legendary Navigation School along Portugal’s southern coast (financing expeditions with royalties from the Algarve fishing industry), and intrepid explorers set out in caravels from Lagos and Sagres. In the 15th and 16th centuries, they ushered in an Age of Discovery, rounding Africa’s Cape of Good Hope and eventually reaching India and the Pacific. Others found their way to the Americas and Brazil. Opening world trade routes across the globe, they established Portugal as a maritime superpower. Spices, gold, and diamonds flowed across the seas to Lisbon.
Portugal soon lapsed into decline, though, tattered by wars and constitutional crises, and for two centuries or more the Algarve remained isolated from the rest of Europe. Even though the coast received many illustrious visitors from Roman times through the Middle Ages and up to the Edwardian period (when travelers came to luxuriate in Monchique’s spa waters), the Algarve’s elite vacation status is a relatively recent phenomenon. The first resort on the coast, Praia da Rocha, was only “discovered” in the 1930s, and the real build-up didn’t kick into overdrive until the beginning of the 1980s.
Spain’s Costa del Sol developed earlier and more rapidly (and some would say, more disastrously). Yet the lessons of rampant, ill-advised development across the border were not heeded. Only recently has environmental and aesthetic consciousness at least mandated that newer developments be limited to low-rises.
Yet — quite remarkably, in the face of the ongoing tourism onslaught — parts of the Algarve retain their old-fashioned charm. The main road along the coast, EN-125, is lined with ceramic shops and stifled with summertime traffic, but the agricultural countryside to the north is a different world. Flowering orchards and gentle grain fields replace hotels, apartments, and snack bars. A slow, rural lifestyle perseveres against the rush of modern life.
For centuries, fishing has been the Algarve’s lifeblood. Small fishing villages preserve their simple and unaffected ways, seemingly oblivious to the tourist hordes. Scrappy crews of small hand-painted boats troll the waters just offshore, and trawlers fish deep in the Atlantic for big shoals of bacalhau (cod) so beloved by the Portuguese.
A visit to the local fish market is a revealing window into Algarvian life. Negotiations are serious but friendly. The same scenario is played out a thousand times a day at markets all across the region; every town has a market day at least once a month. Farmers bring their livestock to trade, and artisans and itinerant vendors sell their wares.
Not a large area, the Algarve is relatively easy to get around, whether by train or car (an effort that is much more relaxing outside of the main summer season). The distances between mega-resorts and unspoiled villages are surprisingly small.
Besides beaches, the Algarve’s major attractions are towns that lived through centuries of adventure, triumph, and disaster. Faro, Tavira, and Lagos are towns with a strong Moorish influence, and quiet mountain towns like Silves, Alte, and Salir are reminders of the days before golf courses and hotel chains.
Despite the region’s ancient roots, few historic monuments survive from before 1755, when the Algarve was rocked by a monumental earthquake that took thousands of lives and leveled buildings as far north as Lisbon. Still, you’ll find vestiges of a vibrant past, including evocative castle ruins and churches with extraordinary displays of Portuguese glazed tiles. Even the humblest village has a classic white church, a sleepy plaza shaded by vivid purple jacaranda, and, if you time it right, the drama of the local market.
The Portuguese are famously hospitable, if reserved. And they remain tolerant and helpful, even though they know that their lovely coast is no longer just theirs.
