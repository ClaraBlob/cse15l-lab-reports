      6         Los Angeles and Its People
      7         Los Angeles, perhaps more than any other place on earth,
      8         is preceded by its reputation. Here is a city teeming with movie stars,
      9         exorbitant wealth, sunny beaches, palm trees, and beautiful people. But
     10         L.A. is also linked with adventure and maybe even danger, complete with
     11         earthquakes, floods, crime, and scandals of O. J. Simpson proportions.
     12         Because the world is watching, it’s a town eternally destined to make a
     13         spectacle of itself, whether on-screen or in real life. The result is a
     14         modern-day “wild West” meshed with everyday life, where image is
     15         reality, poverty clashes with wealth, and fame is acquired
     16         overnight — all publicized to the hilt around the globe.
     17         The world’s perception, however, hardly reflects the real
     18         Los Angeles. The city is not merely beautiful coastlines, hit TV shows,
     19         opulent mansions in the hills, and the latest in celebrity gossip. Los
     20         Angeles County is a collection of 88 separate, incorporated cities
     21         packed between the Pacific Ocean and Orange and San Bernardino
     22         counties. Many of these towns have their own city halls, police forces,
     23         and fire brigades.
     24         The result is that L.A. is a place without a geographic
     25         heart, but with lots of soul. If its soul is superficial, flighty, and
     26         playful — well, this is the entertainment capital of the world!
     27         Los Angeles encompasses a huge variety of American life
     28         within its borders. In fact, the cultural and economic lifestyles of
     29         more than 91⁄2 million county residents vary so enormously from area to
     30         area that visiting Los Angeles is like visiting half a dozen
     31         destinations at once. You can go casual and carefree with the beach
     32         scene, blow the bank on a ritzy Beverly Hills shopping excursion,
     33         retreat to nature on a mountain hike, opt for the “global” by touring
     34         the ethnic neighborhoods, flee to fantasy at any number of amusement
     35         parks, or simply entertain yourself with an exploration into the
     36         entertainment world and Hollywood exotica. Whatever you do, you’ll
     37         experience in-your-face L.A., because its eccentricities are abundant
     38         wherever you go.
     39         The one attribute that suffuses everything in Los Angeles is
     40         its lively energy. Even on your first visit there’s no denying the
     41         feeling that something — somewhere — is about to happen. It might be
     42         catching the eye of your favorite celebrity scurrying into a movie
     43         theater, watching a production company shoot a scene from the next big
     44         blockbuster movie, attempting to keep up with the freeway’s
     45         pedal-to-the-metal drivers, or simply scanning the twinkling evening
     46         skyline from the heights of the Griffith Observatory. In a town where
     47         the fast lane is the norm and Hollywood isn’t a place but a state of
     48         being, you can’t help feeling part of something exciting and

     49         unpredictable.
     50         Much of this energy can be attributed to the residents
     51         themselves. Nowhere on earth is there a place that attracts such a
     52         diverse population. The fertile basin edged by mountains and sea and
     53         blessed with year-round sunshine attracts all kinds with its ideal
     54         combination of urban and beach living. Then there’s the enormous
     55         international community surrounding the entertainment industry. You’ll
     56         also discover L.A.’s large groups of Americans of Chinese, African,
     57         Korean, Middle Eastern, and Japanese descent. Hispanic Americans
     58         comprise the largest ethnic group of all, with numbers fast approaching
     59         40 percent of the population.
     60         With so many people packed into such a condensed area,
     61         Angelenos are constantly struggling to create unique identities for
     62         themselves, which would be more of a challenge if the town didn’t have
     63         such an “anything goes” attitude. The results are often amusing, if not
     64         outrageous, and can be seen in everything from clothing styles and
     65         choice of car to how Angelenos spend their time and money.
     66         No matter what they expect to see in Los Angeles, visitors
     67         invariably discover sites and experiences that surprise, amuse, shock,
     68         or excite them. And isn’t that the reason to come here?
     69         With the region’s size and never-ending maze of freeways,
     70         it’s no surprise that the car is king in L.A. You must join the masses
     71         traveling the streets and freeways to get the feel of the place. Leave
     72         it to Angelenos to make driving an experience in itself. Here, you are
     73         what you drive, which explains the number of expensive cars beside you
     74         on the road. You will also notice that people don’t let traffic time
     75         stop their productivity — many drivers have their cellular phone
     76         attached to their ear.
     77         Finding your way from one place to another is a major part
     78         of being here; there are attractions scattered from Malibu to
     79         Disneyland. Fortunately, much of what you’ll want to see is accessible
     80         through your car window, because you’ll likely be spending a lot of
     81         time driving from one site to another.
     82         The nation’s ten busiest freeways are all in the L.A.
     83         vicinity. Highway 101, the busiest of all, handles over half a million
     84         cars every day. Strict emission controls for cars and industry have
     85         considerably reduced L.A.’s notorious smog, but air quality can still
     86         be poor. To combat highway congestion and pollution, L.A. is now
     87         building a much-needed light rail network.
     88         Whatever improvements have been made to the county’s
     89         transportation system, they are not going to make you feel any better
     90         when you’re stuck in that unavoidable traffic jam. The good news,
     91         however, is that freeway exits and visitor sites are well marked, and
     92         you’re bound to discover an unexpected attraction to get you off the
     93         road and back to the excitement that is Los Angeles.
