# **Week 5 Lab Report**
Setup
Firstly, delete the `lab7/` directory in my ieng6 account by typing in `<Ctrk>` + `r` and type in `ssh` and press `<tab>` to have `ssh cs15lwi23aad@ieng6.ucsd.edu` then press `<return>`. Then type the command `rm -rf lab7/` to delete the `lab7/` directory along with its files. (`-r`  indicates recursive removal and `-f` indeicates removal without confirmation). 
![]()
Then, delete my existing fork of the `lab7` directory.

Bash Script Creation:

My first step is to sign into my ieng6 account by typing in `<Ctrk>` + `r` and type in `ssh` and press `<tab>` to have `ssh cs15lwi23aad@ieng6.ucsd.edu` then press `<return>`. Then, type in `nano LabReport4ChallengeTasks.sh` to create my bash script and have `nano` open in one line. 

In `nano`, I will type in all the commands that I used for my Lab Report 4 for the challenge tasks, starting from Step 5 and ending at Step 9.
